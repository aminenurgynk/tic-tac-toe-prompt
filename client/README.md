This project includes a "Tic Tac Toe" game played with an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. The game provides an interactive experience to the user and consists of three different screens.

## Screens

### 1.  Entry Screen

In this screen, the user can enter their name and choose the background color of the game board.

### 2. Game List Screen

This screen lists the past games on your computer. Each game is defined with a name and color options.

### 3. Game Screen

This screen is where the actual game takes place. The user makes "X" moves, and OpenAI makes "O" moves. If the game ends in a draw, the game board is automatically reset. When won or lost, the user can start a new game by clicking the restart button.

## Game Flow

The game provides an interactive experience to the user, but in some cases, due to thread fatigue, the game's response may be slow.

## How to Use

1. First, specify your name on the entry screen and choose the background color of the game board.
2. Check the past games on your computer on the game list screen.
3. Make "X" moves on the game screen and wait for OpenAI's "O" moves.
4. If the game ends in a draw, it automatically restarts. When won or lost, click the restart button to start a new game.

## Notes

- The game may experience delays in response time due to thread fatigue.
- Before running the project, go to the terminal or command prompt in the project folder and use the npm install command to install the necessary packages.

## Technologies

- The client side is written in React.js.
- Node.js and Express are used on the server side.

## Thanks

This game is developed using OpenAI's artificial intelligence models. Thanks, OpenAI!
